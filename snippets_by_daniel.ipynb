      "Fai Insurance (Supra) his Lordship Justice Scott (as he then was) at first instance in dealing with Application for matter to be referred to Arbitration pursuant the Contract dealt with the Application as Application for Stay pursuant to s5 of the Arbitration Act. \n",

      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "3.20 In Consort Shipping, Plaintiff after filing the Writ of Summons and prior to filing of the Defence or any steps taken by the Defendant moved the Court for declaration that dispute be referred to arbitration pursuant to the Agreement between the parties. \n",

      "His Lordship Justice Scott initially granted stay on an Extempore Ruling but gave his reasons when dealing with Application for Leave to Appeal the decision to stay the proceedings. \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "3.21 Applicant's Counsel submitted that the decision in Consort Shipping and the Appeal is authority for the proposition that an Application for Stay of Procedure pursuant to Section 5 of the Arbitration Act can be made at any stay of the proceedings. \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",

      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "His Lordship Justice Scott (as he then was) in his reasons stated as follows:- \"Having closely examined section 5 of the Act I concluded that an appearance having been entered and no pleadings having been delivered the Court had jurisdiction to stay the legal proceedings commenced by the Plaintiff and to refer the matter to arbitration providing it was satisfied that: (a) there was no sufficient reason not to refer the matter to arbitration; and (b) the Plaintiff was first, when the writ was issued and secondly, now ready and willing to \"do all things necessary to the proper conduct on the arbitration.\" 3.23 Also his Lordship Justice Ian R Thompson J. \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "A. in respect to the Appeal stated:- \"In my view the applicant's attempt to rely on section 5 of the Arbitration Act is misconceived. \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "That section requires a party seeking to have an action stayed to show that he \"was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary to the proper conduct of the arbitration.\" It is difficult to see why the commencement of the action by the respondent's solicitors before they became aware of the requirement of arbitration in the applicant's standard policy should be regarded as preventing the respondent from showing that it was not in breach of the requirement of section 5, that is to say that at all relevant times it was \"ready and willing to do all things necessary for the conduct of the arbitration\". The commencement of an action in a court of law will often indicate a lack of such readiness and willingness but I agree with Scott J. \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "that it will not necessarily do so and, more particularly, that in the circumstances of the present case it did not do so.\" 3.24 His Lordship further went on to state as follows:- \"The matter in dispute between the parties in pre-eminently suited to determination by arbitration by an arbitrator with experience of ships, their navigation, marine accidents and marine insurance. \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "Doubtless that is why the applicant made it a term of its standard policy referral of disputes to arbitration was to be mandatory. \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "In those circumstances I can find no good reason why the instant dispute should not have been referred to arbitration. \n",

      "\n",
      "I cannot accept that the applicant will suffer detriment from the referral ordered by Scott J. \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "Nor can I accept that any important questions of law are raised that require determination by this Court.\" 3.25 The High Court and Court of Appeal decision in Consort Shipping does not in any way discount or relieve the Applicant to satisfy the requirement of Section 5 of the Arbitration Act, that is the need for the Applicant to apply to stay the proceedings before the Applicant delivers any pleadings or take any other step in the proceedings. \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "3.26 Once the requirements in s5 of the Arbitration Act are met then the Court is to be \"satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to arbitration in accordance with the submission and that the applicant was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary to the proper conduct of the arbitration...\". The use of the word \"and\" means that the Applicant has to satisfy both these limbs. \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "3.27 It appears that the learned Master in Warrens case did not fully appreciate the requirements of section 5 of the Arbitration Act and the reasoning in Consort Shipping's case (both High Court and Court of Appeal). 3.28 Applicant by its Counsel submitted that Applicant had not filed any pleadings and made Stay Application after first appearance on 6th February 2014. \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "3.29 He further submitted that even if filing of Singh's Affidavit and appearing in court on 6th February 2014 were steps in the proceedings Applicant can still apply for stay of proceedings because Applicant had not filed any pleadings. \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "3.30 This submission of the Applicant is misconceived and misconstrued for the very fact of the use of the word \"or\" precludes the Applicant from applying for Stay of proceedings pursuant to section 5 of the Arbitration Act if Applicant does either one of the following after first appearance, that is:- (i) deliver any pleading; (ii) takes any other steps in the proceedings. \n",

      "3.34 It must be noted that in Consort Shipping apart from the Statement of Claim no other pleadings were filed or steps taken in the proceedings. \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "Also as found by the Court of Appeal the Applicant was not aware of the existence of the arbitration clause in the policy at the commencement of the proceedings (paragraph 3.23 of this Ruling refers). 3.35 I hold that the actions taken by the Applicant in the preceding paragraph amounts to step in the proceedings and having taken such steps Applicant is now precluded from seeking Stay of proceedings pursuant to Section 5 of the Arbitration Act. \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "3.36 Even if the actions taken by the Applicant are not deemed to be steps in the proceedings it has failed to satisfy the Court that the Applicant was at the commencement of this proceedings was ready and willing to do all things necessary to the proper conduct of the arbitration. \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "In response to query by the Court the Applicant's Counsel admitted that the Applicant and the Counsel were at all material times aware about the existence of the arbitration clause. \n",

      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "3.37 The Applicant and the Respondent were in contact by correspondence immediately prior to the institution of these proceedings but at no time did either of them served notice for parties to submit the dispute to arbitration. \n",

      "\n",
      "Obviously if the Applicant was ready then it would have moved the Court for a Stay of Proceedings instead of filing Singh's Affidavit and attending Court by its Counsel on 6th February 2014 to oppose the Application for Interim Injunction. \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "3.39 Furthermore I take note of the following in respect Clause 25.0 of the Digicel Agreement and the claim filed by the Respondent:- (i) No dispute notice have been served on by either party on the other (clause 25.1.1); (ii) If either believed that there was a dispute to be resolved by arbitration then it should have served dispute notice on the other; (iii) Since, there is no arbitration pending there is nothing stopping a party from instituting court proceedings (Clause 25.4); (iv) If the matter is referred to arbitration then Applicant and Respondent must continue to carry out its obligation under the Digicel Agreement which may be impossible given the existence of the Vodafone Agreement (Clause 25.5); (v) Respondent's claim is for breach of contract and alleged failure by Applicant to exclusively negotiate renewal of Digicel Agreement with it and alleged failure by Applicant to let Plaintiff match the sponsorship offer of Vodafone Consortium; (vi) Whether the Defendant has breached the Digicel Agreement; the enforceability of the matching clause in the Digicel Agreement are questions of law which can only be determined by Court of Law; (vii) The reliefs sought by the Respondent are for specific performance of the Digicel Agreement and mandatory Injunction to direct Applicant to acknowledge Respondent's matching on offer which needs to be determined by Court; (viii) Subsequently if there is a need for any issue or matters to be referred to experts either party may apply to Court pursuant to Order 40 of the High Court Rules. \n",

Sakiusa Naqau, you stand convicted after trial for the offence of Rape contrary to sections 207(1) and 207(2)(b) of the Crimes Decree 2009. 2. The brief facts of the case were that you, with your cousin brother invited the victim and her cousin brother for drinks and had drinks beside the bamboo tree near the Nausori club. After finishing the drinks, when the brother of the victim went to get a taxi to go home, you made sexual advance to the victim. When she refused, you punched her and the victim sustained injuries. You assaulted her, weakened her, removed her T-shirt and the pants and forced her to suck your penis. Victim refused and you inserted your finger into her vagina without her consent. 3. The aggravating factors in this case are that you with your ulterior motive invited the victim for drinks. When the victim refused to consent to your sexual acts, you punched her and assaulted her. She was injured on her face and upper lip due to your assaults. 4. In mitigation, you submitted to court that you are married and having 4 children. Three of them are attending secondary school and the youngest is 18 months old. You are the sole bread winner of the family. You work as a driver for Public Works Department. Your wife is 6 months pregnant. You have no previous convictions within the last 10 years. 5. Further I also consider what is said about you by Pastor Volau Mateyawa by his letter dated 28/02/2011. 6. In the case of Kasim v State (1994) FJCA 25; AAU 0021j.93S (27 May 1994) it was decided that the starting point for sentencing an adult in any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features, should be a term of imprisonment of 7 years. 7. In Mohammed Kasim's case court said: \"While it is undoubted that the gravity of rape cases will differ widely depending on all the circumstances, we think the time has come for this Court to give a clear guidance to the Courts in Fiji generally on this matter. We consider that in any rape case without aggravating or mitigating features the starting point for sentencing an adult should be a term of imprisonment of seven years. It must be recognized by the Courts that the crime of rape has become altogether too frequent and that the sentences imposed by the Courts for that crime must more nearly reflect the understandable public outrage. We must stress, however, that the particular circumstances of a case will mean that there are cases where the proper sentence may be substantially higher or substantially lower than that starting point\". 8. I take 7 years imprisonment as the starting point. I add 5 years for the aggravating factors mentioned above which I consider very seriously the fact that you assaulted the victim injuring her when she refused to consent. Now your interim total sentence is 12 years. I deduct 3 years for your mitigating factors mentioned before, making the interim total to 9 years. 9. Your final sentence is 9 years imprisonment. 10. You are not eligible to be released on parole until you serve a minimum period of 7 years. Priyantha Fernando Judge At Suva 2nd March 2012\"\"\""
